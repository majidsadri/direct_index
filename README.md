# Investment Planning and Direct Indexing Tool

## Overview

This Investment Planning and Direct Indexing Tool is designed to provide investors with a sophisticated strategy to replicate the performance of an index by directly purchasing individual stocks. The tool dynamically allocates investment based on an index-like strategy with customizable weight adjustments and includes basic portfolio optimization based on historical returns. It adjusts the portfolio based on a simple risk tolerance parameter, allowing for a tailored investment approach.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Data Fetching**: Leverages the `yfinance` package to fetch up-to-date stock prices and historical data for analysis.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Dynamically allocates investment based on customized weight adjustments to mimic an index strategy.
- **Basic Portfolio Optimization**: Incorporates a simple form of portfolio optimization based on historical returns and volatility, adjusting for risk tolerance.
- **Risk Tolerance Adjustment**: Allows users to adjust their investment strategy based on a risk tolerance parameter, balancing between risk-averse and risk-tolerant portfolio allocations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `yfinance`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

## Setup

To set up the tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install yfinance numpy pandas
    ```

3. Clone this repository or download the tool's source code.

## Usage

To use the tool, execute the script with Python. You can modify the `stocks` list and `initial_weights` in the script to match your desired index or investment strategy.

    ```sh
    python investment_planning_tool.py
    ```


The script will output an investment plan, detailing the number of shares to buy for each stock based on the current investment strategy and market data.

## Correlation Calculation with S&P 500

This project includes functionality to calculate the correlation between individual S&P 500 stocks and the S&P 500 index itself. The goal is to identify stocks that closely mimic the trends of the S&P 500, enabling the creation of a portfolio that reflects the overall market performance.

### Overview

The process consists of several key steps:

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock prices for the S&P 500 index and individual S&P 500 stocks, focusing on adjusted close prices over a specific period.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily returns of individual stocks and the S&P 500, identifying stocks whose movements are most similar to the index.
- **Stock Selection**: Selects the top 10 stocks with the highest correlation to the S&P 500 index for portfolio construction, aiming to mirror the index's performance as closely as possible.
- **Implementation Details**: Includes fetching data, calculating daily returns, analyzing correlations, and selecting top correlated stocks. The code is designed with error handling to manage potential issues during data fetching.


## Customization

- **Stocks and Weights**: Customize the `stocks` list and `initial_weights` array in the script to match your target index or preferred stocks.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the `risk_tolerance` variable to modify the portfolio's risk profile, ranging from 0 (completely risk-averse) to 1 (fully risk-tolerant).
